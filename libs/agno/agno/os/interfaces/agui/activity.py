"""Workflow progress -> opt-in AG-UI ACTIVITY channel.

Dual-emits the same workflow_progress dict the STATE channel carries as
ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT / ACTIVITY_DELTA, so AG-UI clients can render the run's
progress as a distinct activity card (CopilotKit: a renderActivityMessages
entry keyed on this module's activity_type). Always ADDITIVE beside the
auto-rendering STATE channel, never replacing it, and opt-in
(AGUI(emit_activity=True), default off) -- flag off keeps the wire
byte-identical.

Protocol: snapshot-first (clients silently drop deltas for unknown activity
ids), then RFC 6902 deltas rooted at the activity content -- NOT at run_state,
whose patch paths the STATE channel uses -- then a full snapshot at every
terminal (completed and error) as an authoritative resync: terminal sweeps
(mark_completed / error_snapshot) mutate progress outside progress_handler,
so deltas alone cannot carry them. One activity per run: the message id is
stable for the run's lifetime, so client-side snapshots replace in place.
