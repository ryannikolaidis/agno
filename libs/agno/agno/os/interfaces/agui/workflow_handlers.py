"""Workflow-specific event handling for the AG-UI interface.

A streaming workflow re-emits its inner agent/team events (content, tool calls,
reasoning), which the standard handlers already translate — so this module only
covers what is workflow-specific: identifying the structural events (routed to the
native STATE workflow_progress handler in handlers.py) and resolving the terminal
events (completed / error) at completion time. Cancellation is intentionally NOT
terminal here: it surfaces as a STATE status ("cancelled") and the run finalizes
cleanly with a RUN_FINISHED.
